## About me
I have a bachelor degree in Game Design from Uppsala University.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on improving my skills in C#/.Net, HTML, CSS and Javacript

ðŸŒ± I'm planning to add smaller projects here as I go. Everything from smaller things to more advances things like:
- Design patterns (Command pattern, Observer pattern etc)
- Path finding algorithms like A* pathfinding or something similar
- Boids algorithm
- AI (like behaviour Trees, Utility AI and Fuzzy logic)
- Maybe Procedural Generation or other fun stuff.
